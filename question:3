Question #3) Letâ€™s say you have a CSV input file that contains thousands of credit card
transactions. See sample below:
Date,Description,TransactionAmount
2023-10-01,Fuel,30.0
2023-10-10,Fuel,41.0
2023-10-31,Fuel,35.0

3a) Write a simple block of Python code that (a) reads the input file (and all of its transactions)
and (b) calculates the average transaction amount across all records.

Answer in question3.py


3b) If this file were to be saved in a GCS bucket, how could you access it from BigQuery?


First I load gsc files in Bigquery datasets

LOAD DATA OVERWRITE `inmar.credit_card.transcation_details`
FROM FILES (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['gs://bucket/path/file.csv']);



 Then write bq query to calculate avg

 SELECT AVG(TransactionAmount ) AS average_transaction_amount
FROM `inmar.credit_card.transcation_details`;
