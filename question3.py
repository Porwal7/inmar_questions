# Question #3) Letâ€™s say you have a CSV input file that contains thousands of credit card
# transactions. See sample below:
# Date,Description,TransactionAmount
# 2023-10-01,Fuel,30.0
# 2023-10-10,Fuel,41.0
# 2023-10-31,Fuel,35.0
#
# 3a) Write a simple block of Python code that (a) reads the input file (and all of its transactions)
# and (b) calculates the average transaction amount across all records.

	return df

	return round(pd_df['TransactionAmount'].mean(), 2)

	transaction_df = read_csv()
	print(get_avg(transaction_df))
